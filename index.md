## Welcome

This is my personal website, meant to showcase my professional skills to potential emplpoyers, as well as serve as a repository for personal projects I've done on my own time. This could be Raspberry Pi projects, mobile application development, game development, etc. On this site you wil (eventually) find my extended resume, which indludes work experience, skills, etc.
